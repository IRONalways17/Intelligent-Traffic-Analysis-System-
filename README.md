# Intelligent Traffic Analysis System

## Overview

The Intelligent Traffic Analysis System is an advanced computer vision and machine learning solution designed to analyze traffic patterns in real-time, detect vehicles, calculate traffic metrics, and optimize signal timing to reduce congestion.

## Features

- **Real-time Vehicle Detection**: Uses deep learning models (YOLOv3) to detect vehicles in traffic camera footage
- **Traffic Metrics Calculation**: Measures vehicle counts, density, and flow rates
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies traffic patterns using clustering algorithms
- **Signal Timing Optimization**: Generates optimal traffic signal timings based on detected patterns
- **Predictive Analytics**: Forecasts future traffic conditions using LSTM neural networks
- **Data Visualization**: Provides comprehensive visualization of traffic data and patterns
- **Database Integration**: Stores all traffic data in a structured SQL database for historical analysis

## System Architecture

The system consists of several key components:

1. **Vehicle Detector**: Computer vision module that identifies and counts vehicles in video streams
2. **Traffic Analyzer**: Processes raw detection data to calculate traffic metrics and identify patterns
3. **Signal Optimizer**: Generates optimal signal timings based on current and predicted traffic conditions
4. **Database**: Stores all traffic data, patterns, and signal configurations
5. **Visualization Module**: Creates graphs and visual representations of traffic data
